# Provenance

## Purpose

Direct Zig bindings to the Nickel configuration language (nickel-lang).

Unlike bunsenite (which embeds Nickel in a larger system), this provides standalone FFI access to Nickel's evaluation engine for any project.

## Use Cases

- Evaluate Nickel configurations from Zig programs
- Embed Nickel scripting in applications
- Type-check Nickel files programmatically
